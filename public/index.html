    <span class="instructionsTitle">Feeling lost?</span>
    <p>Who isn't? Okay, seriously now. I would like you to answer the existential question above, in the most seriously and profound way you can. Just don't tell me your whole life story, try to keep it in 10-50 words. Everytime you refresh the page, you get a new one. Have fun!</p>

    <span class="instructionsTitle">But why?</span>
    <p>Okay, I'll tell you why. My name is Nathan M. Seward, and I'm an Artificial Intelligence Researcher and occasional Philosopher. I'm trying to understand if we, "humans", can still distinguish between ourselves and the "robots", or if it is too late. By answering the question above, you enter the dataset of human answers. These answers will then be mixed in with AI-generated answers, and it's up to ourselves to see if we can spot the impostor.</p>

    <span class="instructionsTitle">Want to take part in the test yourself?</span>
    <p>If you answered a question above, you already have (Thank you!). If you would like to see the results and try to find for yourself the AI answers, I like to share my test notes in my <a href="https://twitter.com/cturingtest">Twitter</a>. Each test note has 3 human answers and 1 AI answer. Good luck!</p>

        <h2>A Contemporary Turing Test</h2>
        <p>A project developed by Pedro Churro for the Computational Design Laboratory subject in the Master's in Design and Multimedia course of Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the University of Coimbra, with the support of the professors Tiago Martins, João M. Cunha, Pedro Silva, and Sérgio M. Rebelo.</p>
        <p>The subject's purpose was for the students to develop a design project which had programming as the key factor, and explored a theme from the 2022 edition of the International Symposium on Electronic Art. This project followed the "Human and Non-human" theme and aimed to be an exploration of Machine Learning for text generation and it's use in today's society.</p>
