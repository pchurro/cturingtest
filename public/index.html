    <p>Who isn't? Okay, seriously now. I would like you to answer the existential question above, in the most seriously and profound way you can. Just don't tell me your whole life story, try to keep it in 10-50 words. Everytime you refresh the page, you get a new one. Have fun!</p>

    <span class="instructionsTitle">But why?</span>
    <p>Okay, I'll tell you why. My name is Nathan M. Seward, and I'm an Artificial Intelligence Researcher and occasional Philosopher. I'm trying to understand if we, "humans", can still distinguish between ourselves and the "robots", or if it is too late. By answering the question above, you enter the dataset of human answers. These answers will then be mixed in with AI-generated answers, and it's up to ourselves to see if we can spot the impostor.</p>

    <span class="instructionsTitle">Want to take part in the test yourself?</span>
    <p>Sure! I like to share my test notes in my <a href="https://twitter.com/cturingtest">Twitter</a>. Each test note has 3 human answers and 1 AI answer. Try to find it!</p>
